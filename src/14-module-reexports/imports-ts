// thus if we were to use the exports in this file we would
// need to to import them first
// normally we would import one by one:

// import { Course } from "./course-model";
// import { loadAllCourses } from "./feature-1";
// import { SaveCourse } from "./feature-2";

// but with our import barrel, we can now streamline the import to one file
// and since it is saved in a file named index.ts in this directory, we only
// need to specify the . in the from clause.
import { IndividualCouse, loadfunctionality, savefunctionality } from ".";

// note that if we were to import this to a different folder the from clause would be 
// from "./14-module-exports";
